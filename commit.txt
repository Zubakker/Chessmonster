add under_attack support for all pieces

Now all pieces have functions return_attack() and validate_attack()
so board.under_attack variable should be working normally.
Things that haven't been done:
* King can still move to an under attack square and can be captured
* Attacks that require a pinned piece to move still show as valid 
  attacks as if the piece wasn't pinned
